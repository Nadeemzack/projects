## Low-Level Design (LLD) with an example:

**LLD Explained**

Low-Level Design (LLD) dives deeper into the specifics of a system's individual components. It acts as a technical roadmap for developers, providing detailed instructions on how each component will be implemented. LLDs are essential for:

- **Detailed Implementation Guidance:** They outline the algorithms, data structures, and specific coding techniques that will be used to build each module.
- **Modular Design:** By focusing on individual components, LLDs promote modular development, where components are independent and can be developed and tested in isolation.
- **Improved Maintainability:** Well-defined LLDs make code easier to understand, modify, and debug in the long run.

**Key LLD Components:**

- **Algorithms and Data Structures:** The specific methods used to perform calculations, manipulate data, and achieve the component's functionality.
- **Database Design:** How data will be stored and accessed, including tables, columns, relationships, and queries.
- **Class Structure:** Definitions of classes with attributes, methods, and interactions for object-oriented programming.
- **API (Application Programming Interface) Details:** Specifications for how different components will interact with each other, including function names, parameters, and return values.

**LLD Example: Online Shopping Cart System (Expanding on the HLD)**

Let's revisit the online shopping cart system's `Product Catalog` component from the HLD example and create an LLD for it:

**Product Catalog LLD:**

- **Data Structures:** We might choose to store product data in a dictionary-like structure for efficient lookups, with product IDs as keys and product details (name, description, price, image URL, etc.) as values.
- **Database Design:** Alternatively, we could define a relational database schema with a `products` table containing columns for `product_id` (primary key), `name`, `description`, `price`, `image_url`, and potentially others.
- **Class Structure:** We could create a `Product` class with attributes like `name`, `description`, `price`, and `image_url`. Methods might include:
  - `get_details()`: Returns all product details for a given product.
  - `get_price()`: Returns the price of a product.
  - `search_by_name(name)`: Searches for products matching a specific name (if implementing text search functionality).

**LLD Considerations:**

- **Efficiency:** Choose algorithms and data structures that optimize performance based on anticipated usage patterns.
- **Reusability:** Design components with potential for reuse in other parts of the system or future projects.
- **Testability:** Ensure components are designed in a way that facilitates unit testing to assess their correctness.
- **Error Handling:** Define how the component will handle potential errors or unexpected conditions.

**LLD is the bridge between the high-level vision of the system and the actual implementation code. By creating detailed LLDs, developers have a clear blueprint to follow, leading to more efficient, maintainable, and robust software development.**
